-- TRACK-017 step 2 (D2): sp_get_rider_status narrows to a guardian's own riders.
--
-- p_guardian_user_id is the caller's user id when their access level is `portal`, NULL for everyone
-- else, so an operator's and an organization user's answers are unchanged. A rider outside the
-- guardian's scope raises rider.not-found, the same answer another tenant's rider already gets
-- (TRACK-015): a caller learns nothing about the rows it may not see.
--
-- The parameter list changes, so DROP + CREATE (sql.md).
